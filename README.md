    The purpose of this repository is to investigate and highlight interesting facts from the <i>Housing Decisions of Older Australians</i> open dataset.  Why am I investigating this data? Mainly because House prices in Australia have soared in recent years, where the majority of ownership is held by Baby boomers (born between 1954-64) or older. As this demographic is the majority group which controls the wealth of Australian assets, it would be interesting to research their future strategies heading into retirement.
    
Particular sections of interest in the dataset which will be investigated in this repository are:
    <ul type="square">
      <li>General demographics;</li>
      <li>Planning for retirement;</li>
      <li>Inheritance; and</li>
      <li>Downsizing.</li>
